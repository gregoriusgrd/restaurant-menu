# Restaurant Menu Final Project üçΩÔ∏è
This is my final project for The Origins I: HTML on Cod√©dex.

## Requirements üìã:

a. The HTML file should be properly structured (Hint: start with ```<!DOCTYPE html>```).

b. A ```<title>``` element with the restaurant name should be included in the ```<head>``` element.

c. A header section that features:

- An image with an ```id``` of "header-img".
- A ```<h1>``` heading element with the name of the restaurant.
- A navigation section with two headings for ```"#menu"``` and ```"#order-form"```.

d. A main section for the menu and order form, featuring:

1. Two sections, each with a ```<h2>``` heading that says "Menu" and "Place Your Order".

2. The "Menu" section should have at least three ```<article>``` elements for the menu items that use the following elements:

- An ```<img>``` image element.
- A ```<h3>``` element for the name of the menu item.
- A ```<p>``` paragraph element that briefly describes the item (1-2 sentences) and includes price information (italicized).
  
3. The "Place Your Order" section must include a ```<form>``` element with the following inputs:
- Number inputs for each menu item (make sure to validate input with a minimum of 0).
- Radio and/or checkbox inputs for things like sides and add-ons.
- At least one ```<textarea>``` element for one of the items (for special requests).
- A submit input that says "Go To Checkout".
- Note: Make sure to include a ```<label>``` element for each <input> element.

e. A footer that includes a ```<p>``` paragraph element that reads "Made with love by " followed by your Cod√©dex username.
